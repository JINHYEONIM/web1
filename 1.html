    <p>Studies that estimate and rank the most common words in English examine texts written in English.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:80px;">Perhaps the most comprehensive such analysis is one that was conducted against the Oxford English Corpus (OEC),</p>
    <p>a very large collection of texts from around the world that are written in the English language.</p>
    <p>A text corpus is a large collection of written works that are organised in a way that makes such analysis easier.</p>

    <p>In total, the texts in the Oxford English Corpus contain more than 2 billion words.[1]</p>
  <p>The OEC includes a wide variety of writing samples, such as literary works, novels, academic journals, newspapers, magazines,</p>
    <p>Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, blogs, chat logs, and emails.[2]</p>
